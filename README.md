### Here are the 5 Features of this Web Application(MERN):

1. This application can be used by 3 different types of employees of a company. To manage the daily work of the company employees, HR, and admin all these workers can do their daily tasks in the same place.
2. The employees can submit their work report and can check their salary status from this website. These things are pretty easy to do on this website employee simply log in and navigate to their dashboard from that dashboard they can see all the necessary routes they might need.
3. HR is a very important role for a company their jobs are very important. So, here I tried to make their job a little bit easier. They can check employee's work because I connected them to the database and they can filter out by employee name, name and date or only date. They can give salaries to employees but before that, the system can also check if the employee has been paid before for that time period.
4. An admin can also work on this website. they can see all the employees and if they want they can promote a normal employee to HR by just clicking a button and after being promoted they can start the job as HR right away. They also can fire someone with the same process as well.
5. After getting fired the user ex-employee can no longer access the system they can upload works or see payment history basically their dashboard will be disabled.
So, these are the features I think are worth to feature here. I will be waiting for your feedback.
